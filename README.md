🎓 Student Performance Prediction App
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts a student’s final exam performance (average score or grade) based on various factors like demographics, parental education, and test preparation.
The goal is to help educators and students understand how different factors impact academic outcomes.

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

Linear Regression – for a simple, interpretable baseline model.

Gradient Boosting Regressor – for more accurate, nonlinear prediction.

Both models are trained on the StudentsPerformance.csv dataset from Kaggle.
